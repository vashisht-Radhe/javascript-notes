# Data Types

**What are Data Type**

A data type defines **what kind of value** a variable can hold and **what operations** can be perfomed on it.

*In Javascript, data types are dynamic*

- we don't declare the type
- JavaScript decides it at runtime

```javascript
let x = 10; // number
x = "hello"; // string
```

## Classification of Data Types

JavaScript data types are divided into two main categories:

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
